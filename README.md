# Store-Manager

Project done at Trybe, using a MySQL DB, managing basic CRUD operations using node and docker.

An API using MSC (Model, Service, Controller) architecture, I built an app that is responsible for managing sales on a store, working with MySQL DB to store them.

## Installation and use

The DB port is 3306

  use cd to get into the directory
  docker-compose up -d
  Connect to the DB and populate it using the scripts migration and seed
